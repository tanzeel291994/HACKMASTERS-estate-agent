NEIGHBOURHOOD","The apartments in International City are organised into clusters
In a city as cosmopolitan as Dubai, it makes perfect sense to have a community named after the global vibe of the emirate. International City is essentially a residential compound offering people access to community living without a hefty price tag. The 10 prominent building clusters housing the apartments in International City are named after countries around the world, earning the development the moniker of ‘International’ City.
As for the residential side, there is a range of properties from studios to townhomes and villas. Besides the unit and configuration type, one can decide between a wide range of options based on what suits them best. If you’re on a budget, you can rent one of the unfurnished apartments in International City costing around AED 14k, per annum at the minimum. Likewise, those looking to move-in and settle down immediately without paying a hefty amount can buy ready studios in International City.
The development did have a rocky start with some concerns about sanitation, but things have stabilised now and it’s developing into a sought-after location to live in Dubai. Living in International City will never be boring thanks to the two huge Dragon Marts: full of obscure finds, budget deals, restaurants and cinemas.","International City has a number of freehold properties
There are over 500 apartments in International City spread over the 10 residential clusters. The second phase of the project is also under development where a few buildings have even been opened up to buyers and renters. Rental properties in International City are popular among expatriate families and individuals.
